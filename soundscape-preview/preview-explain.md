**Preview!**

In this clip, I have the opening two tracks of the desk lamp clicking on and someone working at their desk. The idea is that these audio clips will frame the rest of the narrative as existing inside someone's head while they work, rather than being an actual train. I also tried to fade out the work-session clip while fading in the train whistle clip to make that transition from real life to imagination more clear.

After the train whistle, I introduce the train announcer voice, which I edited with Distortion and the Graphic EQ Effects options to try to recreate a PA-system type effect. I want the announcer to be a faux-cheery customer service type character who comes off as a little tired of some of the thoughts on her train (feedback on if this effect and tone come across as intended would be great!).

For the train track, I blended three separate clips together (the train whistle, the train on the track, and the train slowing to a stop). I was wondering if they sounded blended enough to not distract from the announcer/storyline? There's a kind of metal-grating sound in the track track audio around 35 seconds in that I would like to reduce, if anyone knows how? The noise reduction effect was my first instinct, but I'm not sure how to tune it to reduce only that high screeching frequency?

Another thing I did with the train track was that I tried to use the Envelope tool to lower the train audio while the voice was talking, and raise it back up to give a short clip of "travel time". The last thing I added was crossfading the train tracks clip into the clip of a train stopping, with an announcement about the stop. I hope to add some audio of passengers de-boarding next to make that cutoff of train noise less unnatural. From there, I would like to add the run-in of the train with the brain-storm.

As a total newbie to Audacity, I have been learning about effects and crossfading clips and such on the fly, so any feedback on whether or not transitions between clips sound natural, and especially any suggestions on edits to improve them, would be much appreciated!

(As a side note: please ignore the hanging clip of train tracks at around 1:45, I split a track and intend to incorporate the rest of it later on in the project.)
