**Carolyn Priestley's soundscape narrative**

*Title:* All Aboard!

*Brief summary:* A train of thought is shipping worries and ideas about my head as usual, when it gets swept up into a problematic brainstorm.

*Note:* The full Audacity file can be found in the all-aboard-soundscape folder, with the .mp3 files for the Tuesday preview and Thursday full draft milestones are in the soundscape-preview folder and soundscape-full-cut folders respectively.
