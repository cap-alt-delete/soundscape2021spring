**Carolyn Priestley's soundscape narrative**

*Title:* All Aboard!

*Brief summary:* The Train of Thought is shipping worries and ideas about a student's head as usual, when it gets delayed by a rather problematic brainstorm.

*Note:* The full Audacity file can be found in the *all-aboard-soundscape* folder. The .mp3 files/notes/screenshots for the Tuesday preview and Thursday full draft milestones are in the *soundscape-preview* folder and *soundscape-full-cut* folder respectively. Pictures of progress can be found in the *progress-screenshots* folder. *assets-chart.md* was my working file for collecting/tracking assets, with final asset citations in *citations.md*.
