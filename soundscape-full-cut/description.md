**Some notes on the first full cut of my soundscape:**

1. I tried to parallel the opening and closing of the soundscape by having the desk lamp click on and work begin to open, then closing out with work ending and the desk lamp clicking off.

2. For the clips of typing, I'm not sure if I should add music or something else. Feedback on whether it sounds too flat without it would be appreciated! I added music to the first half, but left the second half without, to show the two options and see what people preferred. However, in the end I want both sections to mirror each other in terms of both having or not having music.
    a. *If I add music, one idea I toyed with was having the music playing instead of passenger noise whenever the train stops, to make the train feel more linked to being in the person's head. But I'm not sure if that will confuse the narrative too much.*

3. To segue into the main train storyline, I tried to use the fade-in/fade-out effects to have a gradual transition.

4. The train sounds are several clips from Freesound blended together, so I would love feedback on whether there are any parts that sound unnatural/distract from the plot.

5. I felt like I was having some difficulty with mixing the sounds of the train and the rainstorm so that each was clear, if anyone has tips.

6. One effect I tried experimenting with toward the end was the panning L/R with the windows shutting (essentially trying to have it sound like some close to the left, then others close to the right of the listener).
